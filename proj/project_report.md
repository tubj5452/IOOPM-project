## Process
3.1 Inception
In this section, discuss choice of process, how you went about learning the process, how you went about implementing the process.

3.2 Implementation
In this section, discuss:

    what you actually implemented of the process
    strengths and weaknesses with your implementation of your chosen process
    what you would do differently if you were to start over tomorrow
    what successes you would attempt to repeat if you were to start over tomorrow
    how plans were made, key plans, and to what extent your plans were followed
    how decision making happened, key decisions, and whether they were followed
    how did you attack the Christmas break problem with planning?

## Use of Tools
In this section, discuss:

    what tools you used in the project
    what use you had of those tools
    if there were any tools you were lacking
    tools you would rather not use in the future

## Communication, Cooperation and Coordination
In this section, discuss:

    the communication between team members and with people outside the team
    the cooperation between team members
    the coordination between team members with respect to technical tasks
    how did you deal with team members that were demotivated, angry, stressed about things outside of the project?
    how did you handle communication, cooperation and coordination during the break?
    lessons learned

## Work Breakdown Structure
In this section, discuss:

    what sprints you planned for and what the time plan for the sprints were
    how the programming tasks were divided, distributed, carried out, load-balanced, etc. – if you used pair programming how did that go? Did you use it for everything?
    what were the actual tasks
    did you manage to load-balance the workload so that no one was overwhelmed, how/why not?
    were tasks of equal sizes or not, and how you handled if they were not
    your thoughts on how does one estimate how much time a task will take

Also, visualise:

    using a burndown chart for the sprints, how your time planning compared with reality.
    using a pie chart, how the time you spent was distributed across different activities. (Refer to the main project task description for activities.) 

## Reflection

In this section, discuss briefly:

    How confident you are that have actually implemented the right thing (why, how, etc.)
    On a scale 1–7 (7 is best), rate your satisfaction with your process and provide justification for that number
    On a scale 1–7 (7 is best), rate your satisfaction with your delivered product and provide justification for that number
    On a scale 1–7 (7 is best), rate your satisfaction with your quality assurance and provide justification for that number
    what does the team consider its biggest win?
    what does the team consider its biggest fail?
