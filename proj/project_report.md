## Process
3.1 Inception
In this section, discuss choice of process, how you went about learning the process, how you went about implementing the process.

3.2 Implementation
In this section, discuss:

    what you actually implemented of the process
    strengths and weaknesses with your implementation of your chosen process
    what you would do differently if you were to start over tomorrow
    what successes you would attempt to repeat if you were to start over tomorrow
    how plans were made, key plans, and to what extent your plans were followed
    how decision making happened, key decisions, and whether they were followed
    how did you attack the Christmas break problem with planning?

## Use of Tools


We haven't used that many different tools in the project. In external uses, this has mainly been Make. This is due to learning this early in the coruse, which further led to us knowing how it worked and easly being able to compile and run the program we work on. Since we had multiple Makefiles, this led to us needing to change quite a few files in order to run different parts of the code. This was mainly shown when integration started, as some parts of the code wanted to be ran, while we worked on different parts. This led to learning how to extend the Makfile so that it fulfilled the goal that wanted to be coded.

A lot of internal tools in C has been used as well. Most of these were tools that we had previously learned, such as CUnit, gdb, and coverage checking, but also some that not all of us had previously used, such as coverage checking. Since all of us was used to CUnit from earlier in the course, this wasn't a problem to work with and adapt for our own use. This meant that we could use those heavily, and rely on our knowledge that we knew how they worked.

TODO: Tools that were lacking and too we'd rather not use in the future.




In this section, discuss:

    what tools you used in the project
    what use you had of those tools
    if there were any tools you were lacking
    tools you would rather not use in the future

## Communication, Cooperation and Coordination

### How did we communicate
Most of the communication between team members was online. We decided really early to create a Discord server here we could ask questions and have our main communication. This was mainly as an easy way to reach all team members, and make sure that everyone was on the same page when it came to the code. At the beginning, we also tried to frequently have meetings in person, to make sure that everyone was up to date on where we were in the code. These became more spread-out and over zoom as the holidays came around, and we were spread out all over the world. These were also a bit further apart, as it was harder to coordinate, and we wanted to be able to work whenever we had time on our own.

TODO: How did we communicate with the coach.


### How did it go during the holidays
During the break, we knew that some people maybe had more plans than others, but we decided to divide the work as evenly as we could. This was so that everyone had their own part to work with. At this time, we also made sure to update the discord if we needed help, or if someone could check out a pull request that had been made. This made it so that event though some wanted to spend time with family or focus on our other course, there was still something that could be done. We also made sure to have one meeting where we checked how the work was going, and what we had left. This was also where we decided mainly who should work mainly on each report, as they could be done if someone were to travel for a longer time, or had some spare time to write as their part of the integration was done.



In this section, discuss:

    the communication between team members and with people outside the team
    the cooperation between team members
    the coordination between team members with respect to technical tasks
    how did you deal with team members that were demotivated, angry, stressed about things outside of the project?
    how did you handle communication, cooperation and coordination during the break?
    lessons learned

## Work Breakdown Structure

* Sprint plan exists at the top of the document, as well as some of the meeting projects.

In this section, discuss:

    what sprints you planned for and what the time plan for the sprints were
    how the programming tasks were divided, distributed, carried out, load-balanced, etc. – if you used pair programming how did that go? Did you use it for everything?
    what were the actual tasks
    did you manage to load-balance the workload so that no one was overwhelmed, how/why not?
    were tasks of equal sizes or not, and how you handled if they were not
    your thoughts on how does one estimate how much time a task will take

Also, visualise:

    using a burndown chart for the sprints, how your time planning compared with reality.
    using a pie chart, how the time you spent was distributed across different activities. (Refer to the main project task description for activities.) 

## Reflection

* DO THIS TOGETHER, A REFLECTION OF HOW THE WORK WENT.

In this section, discuss briefly:

    How confident you are that have actually implemented the right thing (why, how, etc.)
    On a scale 1–7 (7 is best), rate your satisfaction with your process and provide justification for that number
    On a scale 1–7 (7 is best), rate your satisfaction with your delivered product and provide justification for that number
    On a scale 1–7 (7 is best), rate your satisfaction with your quality assurance and provide justification for that number
    what does the team consider its biggest win?
    what does the team consider its biggest fail?
