# Individual Reflections
Every project member shall write a short self reflection. 
About 1500–3000 characters, run $ wc -m induvidual_reflections.md to check (tips är att skriva i en egen fil först för att lättare räkna tecken)
What are your strengths and weaknesses in a project? What traits should you enhance, and what do you need to improve?

Fundera på: 
    How do I function in a team? Where are my strengths and weaknesses?
    How should I try to adapt the way I work to work better in a team?
    What motivates me? What demotivates me? How do I stay motivated in a project?
    How good am I at estimating how long a task will take? What is the process that produce my estimations?
    What role do I want to play in a team?
    Hur fungerar du i ett team? Faller du in i ett särskilt mönster, eller tar du återkommande en särskild roll?
    Får du ut något av att jobba i en grupp, eller jobbar du helst ensam?
    Jämför hur mycket du lärt dig under projektarbetet kontra kursens övriga delar, och fundera över hur du bäst lär dig saker.
    Hur har det gått att logga arbetstid?
    “Biggest fail” och “biggest win”, dvs. det största problem som du stötte på och det smartaste eller bästa du gjorde.

This file should convince the examiner that each team member passes Y67.

In this project, I feel like I was good at communicating my ambitions to the group early. What I would improve from this project is my way of handling falling behind schedule. When we fell behind, I just kept working to try to catch up to the initial plan instead of readjusting to a new plan. Although it worked out in this project, it is all thanks to the good work of my group members which is something I cannot depend on in future projects. 

During this project, I found that our means of communication worked well for me. I liked being able to get an overhaul of what was to be done through Trello as well as the frequent group meetings. These means of communication worked well for me and are something that I will keep in mind for future projects. In previous group projects, I have felt that not everyone is informed of what is going on, which has been frustrating. 

In general, I find it difficult to be motivated when there is no room to be creative. During the first weeks of the project, I enjoyed laying the foundations of how the metadata would look and in what ways our reference counter would function. However, I felt quite demotivated during the second half of the project. I recognize that this is something I need to get better at since not all tasks have the playroom that I would prefer, but they need to be checked off anyway as well as the fact that in a group setting, the progress affects not only me but all team members. 

I feel like I have not learned that many new things during the project compared to the rest of the course. However, I feel like I have gotten more confident in both C programming and how pointers work. When it comes to technical skills, I still prefer the structure of the earlier stages of the course.   

My biggest win during the project is the decision to stop arranging the metadata manually by calculating the offsets in memory and starting to use a struct for it instead. It solved many problems that we did not understand and allowed us to move on. After writing the report about this decision I now understand why we got the issues in the first place, which feels even better. 

My biggest loss during the project was probably the way I handled studying for the math exam in parallel to the project. I left very little time for the project because of stress and in retrospect, I feel like if I had structured my hours better, I would have been able to put out more hours even when studying for the exam.

I think I work fairly well in a team. I like to be an all-around person, and play an adaptive role in the process. This means that I want to be able to do many different things, a but still have some main focus area to work in. This meant that I took parts that were left unattended to, and had very varying parts of the work. I could adapt my way of working in a team by taking on a more solid role, and grabbing work more "forcefully", especially in the beginning when I felt as if I wasn't doing as much work.

I get motivated by seeing the final product working. This means that I usually do a lot of my work more "behind-the-scenes" until it's working. This is maybe not the best thing, as people don't really know what stage my work is in, especially if they're waiting for it to work. This is something that I need to work on, though, as I could easily push up code that might not work as well into a separate branch and someone else could use parts of what I've done.

I actually think it's a good thing to work in a group, although I think a smaller group is better. That is because I like to discuss what I'm doing with someone else, and I feel like when I do that, it's easier for me to understand what I've done. I think that I've learned more throughout the course, instead of only the project. This is because I learn by adapting what I've learned in a lecture to something more physical, which we did with the Z-goals.

It went good to log time for me. I decided to manually log time, which worked well for me. For each session, I wrote down the time when I started and the time when I finished that day. If I took a longer pause, I marked it down as well. This might have been one of my bigger fails though, as it meant that I had to keep track on where I logged, which I initally lost due to some technical struggles. Because of these struggles, I had to estimate how much time I spent at the beginning of the project, which meant that some of the time I had logged for the project got lost.

My biggest win of the project was that I, because I hadn't done a project like this before, learned to take a leading role over parts of the final product. This was very fun for me, as I felt normally step back in decision making, and usually just accept what's going on with the code. For me, this was a very new responsibility, that I think was very educational for me.
