# Individual Reflections
Every project member shall write a short self reflection.
About 1500–3000 characters, run $ wc -m induvidual_reflections.md to check (tips är att skriva i en egen fil först för att lättare räkna tecken)
What are your strengths and weaknesses in a project? What traits should you enhance, and what do you need to improve?

Fundera på:
    How do I function in a team? Where are my strengths and weaknesses?
    How should I try to adapt the way I work to work better in a team?
    What motivates me? What demotivates me? How do I stay motivated in a project?
    How good am I at estimating how long a task will take? What is the process that produce my estimations?
    What role do I want to play in a team?
    Hur fungerar du i ett team? Faller du in i ett särskilt mönster, eller tar du återkommande en särskild roll?
    Får du ut något av att jobba i en grupp, eller jobbar du helst ensam?
    Jämför hur mycket du lärt dig under projektarbetet kontra kursens övriga delar, och fundera över hur du bäst lär dig saker.
    Hur har det gått att logga arbetstid?
    “Biggest fail” och “biggest win”, dvs. det största problem som du stötte på och det smartaste eller bästa du gjorde.

This file should convince the examiner that each team member passes Y67.

I want to play the role of organizer and detailer. To make sure the instructions and requirements are followed and everything looks and works unified. For this project I have been functioning as the organizer and project manager. I'm good at keeping track of what needs to be done and by what time. I'm not afraid to speak up if something is not working. Although, I need to be better at motivating my team members. At times I get frustrated when no work has been completed and rather solve it myself instead of having patience and giving tips and tricks. I want to believe I'm a good communicator but I need to be better at motivating others to communicate as well. I should put more trust into my team members and try to help them in collaboration. 

What motivates me is the satisfaction of completing a task. This is applicable to both small and large milestones. Something I need to be better at realizing is that everyone does not have the same motivations as me. I have not been doing good milestone estimations when taking group work into consideration. I tend to be ambitious with my estimates and while all team members agreed on the set milestones it became hard for everyone to keep up, including myself.

I work ok in a team. I like to work as a doer and most often take control of the task to be done. Depending on the team dynamic this pattern has both advantages and disadvantages. What I need to improve is the adaptation of my pattern since this behaviour in some teams might not be beneficial. Although I prefer to work alone I do see many advantages of working in a team. The most foremost benefit is the different viewpoints of a certain problem that comes when several people are looking at it. For this project it has helped me see some problems in a different way than I normally would and be solved more efficiently. Although the bottom line is that I learned more during the assignment-parts during the course. What I enjoyed with the project was a good learning opportunity to apply these skills into a greater project.

It has been going well with keeping time, especially because I have prior experience with time-keeping of work and studies. I have spent 9h and 37 min on scheduled group meetings and 112h and 26 min (TODO:) on working on project assignments. Keeping time has helped give an overview of how much work I actually put in rather than just guessing.

My biggest fail during this project were the bad time estimates for when different parts should be done. Even though the team agreed with our deadlines it was my responsibility to set up more realistic goals from the beginning. My biggest win was my ability to communicate. I have had a track record of not being a good communicator but during this project I feel as if I have been keeping everyone in the loop. For example with regular scheduled meetings, even during the Christmas break, and making sure everyone has something to do.
