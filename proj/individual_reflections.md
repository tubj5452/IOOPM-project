What are your strengths and weaknesses in a project? What traits should you enhance, and what do you need to improve?

Fundera på:
    How do I function in a team? Where are my strengths and weaknesses?
    How should I try to adapt the way I work to work better in a team?
    What motivates me? What demotivates me? How do I stay motivated in a project?
    How good am I at estimating how long a task will take? What is the process that produce my estimations?
    What role do I want to play in a team?
    Hur fungerar du i ett team? Faller du in i ett särskilt mönster, eller tar du återkommande en särskild roll?
    Får du ut något av att jobba i en grupp, eller jobbar du helst ensam?
    Jämför hur mycket du lärt dig under projektarbetet kontra kursens övriga delar, och fundera över hur du bäst lär dig saker.
    Hur har det gått att logga arbetstid?
    “Biggest fail” och “biggest win”, dvs. det största problem som du stötte på och det smartaste eller bästa du gjorde.

In this project, I feel like I was good at communicating my ambitions to the group early. What I would improve from this project is my way of handling falling behind schedule. When we fell behind, I just kept working to try to catch up to the initial plan instead of readjusting to a new plan. Although it worked out in this project, it is all thanks to the good work of my group members which is something I cannot depend on in future projects.

During this project, I found that our means of communication worked well for me. I liked being able to get an overhaul of what was to be done through Trello as well as the frequent group meetings. These means of communication worked well for me and are something that I will keep in mind for future projects. In previous group projects, I have felt that not everyone is informed of what is going on, which has been frustrating.

In general, I find it difficult to be motivated when there is no room to be creative. During the first weeks of the project, I enjoyed laying the foundations of how the metadata would look and in what ways our reference counter would function. However, I felt quite demotivated during the second half of the project. I recognize that this is something I need to get better at since not all tasks have the playroom that I would prefer, but they need to be checked off anyway as well as the fact that in a group setting, the progress affects not only me but all team members.

I feel like I have not learned that many new things during the project compared to the rest of the course. However, I feel like I have gotten more confident in both C programming and how pointers work. When it comes to technical skills, I still prefer the structure of the earlier stages of the course.

My biggest win during the project is the decision to stop arranging the metadata manually by calculating the offsets in memory and starting to use a struct for it instead. It solved many problems that we did not understand and allowed us to move on. After writing the report about this decision I now understand why we got the issues in the first place, which feels even better.

My biggest loss during the project was probably the way I handled studying for the math exam in parallel to the project. I left very little time for the project because of stress and in retrospect, I feel like if I had structured my hours better, I would have been able to put out more hours even when studying for the exam.

I enjoy playing the role of organizer and detailer. To make sure the instructions and requirements are followed and everything looks and works unified. I'm good at keeping track of what needs to be done and by what time. I'm not afraid to speak up if something is not working. Although, I need to be better at motivating my team members. At times I get frustrated when no work has been completed and rather solve it myself instead of having patience. I want to believe I'm a good communicator but I need to be better at motivating others to communicate as well. I should put more trust into my team members and try to help them in collaboration.

What motivates me is the satisfaction of completing a task. This is applicable to both small and large milestones. Something I need to be better at realizing is that everyone does not have the same motivations as me. I have not been doing good milestone estimations when taking group work into consideration. I tend to be ambitious with my estimates and while all team members agreed on the set milestones it became hard for everyone to keep up, including myself.

I work ok in a team. I like to work as a doer and most often take control of the task to be done. Depending on the team dynamic this pattern has both advantages and disadvantages. What I need to improve is the adaptation of my pattern since this behaviour in some teams might not be beneficial. Although I prefer to work alone or in smaller groups I do see many advantages of working in a larger team. The most foremost benefit is the different viewpoints of a certain problem that comes when several people are looking at it. For this project it has helped me see some problems in a different way than I normally would and be solved more efficiently. Although the bottom line is that I learned more during the assignment-parts during the course and what I enjoyed with the project was a good learning opportunity to apply these skills into a greater project.

It has been going well with keeping time, especially because I have prior experience with time-keeping of work and studies. I have spent about 10h on scheduled group meetings and 115h on working on project assignments. Keeping time has helped give an overview of how much work I actually put in rather than just estimatig or guessing.

My biggest fail during this project were the bad time estimates for when different parts should be done. Even though the team agreed with our deadlines it was my responsibility to set up more realistic goals from the beginning. My biggest win was my ability to communicate. I have had a track record of not being a good communicator but during this project I feel as if I have been keeping everyone in the loop. For example with regular scheduled meetings, even during the Christmas break, updating our Trello board and making sure everyone has something to do.

I think I work fairly well in a team. I like to be an all-around person, and play an adaptive role in the process. This means that I want to be able to do many different things, a but still have some main focus area to work in. This meant that I took parts that were left unattended to, and had very varying parts of the work. I could adapt my way of working in a team by taking on a more solid role, and grabbing work more "forcefully", especially in the beginning when I felt as if I wasn't doing as much work.

I get motivated by seeing the final product working. This means that I usually do a lot of my work more "behind-the-scenes" until it's working. This is maybe not the best thing, as people don't really know what stage my work is in, especially if they're waiting for it to work. This is something that I need to work on, though, as I could easily push up code that might not work as well into a separate branch and someone else could use parts of what I've done.

I actually think it's a good thing to work in a group, although I think a smaller group is better. That is because I like to discuss what I'm doing with someone else, and I feel like when I do that, it's easier for me to understand what I've done. I think that I've learned more throughout the course, instead of only the project. This is because I learn by adapting what I've learned in a lecture to something more physical, which we did with the Z-goals.

It went good to log time for me. I decided to manually log time, which worked well for me. For each session, I wrote down the time when I started and the time when I finished that day. If I took a longer pause, I marked it down as well. This might have been one of my bigger fails though, as it meant that I had to keep track on where I logged, which I initally lost due to some technical struggles. Because of these struggles, I had to estimate how much time I spent at the beginning of the project, which meant that some of the time I had logged for the project got lost.

My biggest win of the project was that I, because I hadn't done a project like this before, learned to take a leading role over parts of the final product. This was very fun for me, as I felt normally step back in decision making, and usually just accept what's going on with the code. For me, this was a very new responsibility, that I think was very educational for me.

I like to work in a group,, because it makes it easier to focus and not get distracted, but I often end up working on my own anyway due to the convenience, despite it being less productive for me. So to work better in teams I could ask some of my teammates if they want to work together more often. Difficulty in asking for help and bad time management are my biggest shortcomings when working in groups after all. Speaking of which, estimating the time needed for tasks is something I really need to work on, as there were many times during this project’s I thought and maybe even said I would be able to complete a task that ended up taking way more time than expected. I basically just make uneducated guesses on how long things will take, and almost always low-ball it. At least I documented the time spent well.

I really appreciated how many sprints and deadlines we had during this project, as motivation for me basically has to come from outside pressure such as deadlines or not dragging teammates down. This, alongside me learning best by doing, has made this project and the assignments the most educational parts of the course for me.

For me the part that I most easily fill in a project is quality control; meticulously nitpicking other peoples’ code just comes easier to me than making it from scratch. My biggest wins therefore were my peer reviews, as well as fixing some structural git things, due to my greater familiarity with git relative to my peers. Despite that, the role I end up with varies wildly depending on the project, making me something of a jack of all trades.

As a final note, I do feel a little disappointed in my contributions to this project. I was late to meetings on more than one occasion, I should have naked for help when I got stuck more frequently and quicker, and I could have put more time into it during last year, as I put in significantly more work after new years eve than before. Despite that, I’m overall happy with my performance, even with the negatives.

When it comes to working in a team, I tend to be pretty adaptable in terms of working on different areas, wether it be coding, report-writing etc. To put a light on my strengths and weaknesses, I feel like I am pretty descriptive in terms of writing detailed issue logs, or giving a solid code review on pull requests. Weaknesses tend to be not really having a clear view on the tasks at hand.
I feel like I should try in future projects to not fall back on the group leader for being assigned tasks, because I tend to sometimes not really know what to do after I am done with something. Therefore I need to be more active and really take on certain task, and just actively ask and keep check on what needs to be done in order to avoid this. Usually I like working by myself, but this project has really given me a new perspective on working together, since it is the first time we have worked this many in one group. It feels good to have people with many different sets of skills, because that way you can always turn to someone if you need any help.

What motivates me is of course getting implementations to work, but also feeling like I actually contribute. This naturally leads to me being demotivated by feeling like I have not done enough compared to others, because I do not want to be the person in the group that did the least and still passed. So this brings me back to just being more active and "on it" with the project, and using communication more to actually keep myself updated with all aspects of it.

Estimating how long a certain task will take to complete really boils down to how familiar I am with it. If I know what to do, or at least have a pretty clear starting point, it will unexpectedly not take as long as trying to get to terms with something completely out of my ballpark. So the estimation will most likely be reasonable no matter how much knowledge I have, and if I realize it will take longer I have the group to lean back on for advice. Essentially if I have not figured the solution out within my estimated time, a fresh perspective of it from someone else will most likely help a lot.

In terms of what I have learned in the project compared to the course in general, it is for the most part working together with people which can be difficult when the project is not clearly divided in multiple tasks that can be assigned and worked on by different people. Other than that I definitely have improved in using github, since I have not used it too much before this.

Tracking time has been going reasonably well, I am new to the concept, but it feels good to do it. It really gives you a clear view of how much time is spent on different parts, and the quality also becomes more distinct when logging like this.

Biggest fail was probably sitting way too long trying to get the linked list integration to work, when I should just have published an issue and let others take a look at it instead. As I mentioned earlier, getting a fresh perspective on the problem when you have been staring at the code for hours usually works better. My biggest win might be getting the ```refmem.c```-file to actually work with the object-scanner and default destructor at an earlier stage of the project, but of course changes were made later, but it was something we struggled with a lot in the beginning.

I do think I work fine in a team but I work better when the team is together rather than working alone. I always prefer working in school together with everybody because then everything that needs to be done becomes much clearer to see and understand. 

The way I should adapt to work better is to communicate better with my team on how I prefer to work on the project so that the time and effort I need to put in is the same as my team. I always feel it is better to work together because that makes asking questions and getting answers for all my questions easier and my team's questions too. A motivation for me is working together and understanding the assignment, and sometimes it takes longer for me to do so than others and that’s why the start of the assignment was hard for me. The solution is ofcourse communication with my team, and a demotivation is feeling that I don’t understand what we are doing and all the members of my team do understand it. 

Estimation of how long a task will take is hard for me because when I first get an assignment I first have to count in the start of the project and usually it takes some time for me to get started with something, but when everything with a task is understood it goes much faster to finish the project. The role that I want to play in a team is usually right now not a leader role because I feel it’s difficult to know what needs to be done for the project. I like to know what to do or just have a clear path of what needs to be done, almost like we have done in Trello for this project. I like to work in a group but for this project specifically I feel that 6 people in the project is too many as the project is not a big task if you look past the reports that need to be written. I feel like working in such a big group hasn’t benefited me the best way and I prefer to work in pairs or in a group of 3 or 4 people. So I much preferred working during the Inluppar because then it felt more hands on and you worked closer with your team that you have. Logging the time I have put down has been easy and effective as I only have written up the date and time I started and time I finished. I also commented what part of the project I was working on during the time that I logged. 

The biggest problem I encountered was when working with merch_storage. The file leaked and hade invalid reads which me and another team member worked on for two days straight without coming any closer, or so we thought. The biggest win was that I actually recognised the problem after debugging but didn’t know how to fix it, but I fixed parts of it after testing with different solutions.
