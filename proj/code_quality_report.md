# Code Quality Report
You should explain why you think you have written good code and why you think that the code is good! 
Hur har ni sett till att koden är läsbar för alla i teamet?
Använd gärna ett verktyg (t.ex. astyle) för att automatiskt formattera kod på ett enhetligt sätt.

You can go about this in any way that you like that is helpful to the reviewer. Helpful saves time, meaning that blanket statements such as “just look at all the code” are not good enough (discussing each function individually also would not save time). 

Under kursens gång har kodkvalitet beaktats åtskilliga gånger. Under projektet skall ni skriva kod av hög kvalitet! Vad betyder det? (Läsbarhet? Underhållsbarhet? Prestanda? Korrekthet? Testbarhet? Etc…) Hur har det tagit sig uttryck i ert system? Vad har det fått för konsekvenser?

This file, together with the GitHub issue log, should convince the examiner that you pass Y65.



# ROUGH DRAFT, ADD POINTS BELOW THAT SHOULD BE IN REPORT

## Why have we written good code, why is our code good
* Could be something that should be done in a discussion


## Is the code readable for everyone in the team
* Discussion?


## Helpful to reviewer
* For specifics, look in the instruction above.


## What does it mean to have good code
* Discussion, to write.


## What code standard have we used, how is it good?
* We have decided to use GNU as code standard. It was a democratic choice in the group, which means that we decided this together.

* Why is GNU a good choice. Discuss here.
